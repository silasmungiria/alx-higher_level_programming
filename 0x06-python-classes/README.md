# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

This repository contains solutions to the tasks related to Python classes and objects.

## Background Context

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept in programming, and this project will introduce you to the basics of OOP in Python. It is important to read and understand the provided resources to gain a solid understanding of OOP principles.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external references:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is OOP
- "First-class everything"
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- What are and how to use public, protected, and private attributes
- What is `self`
- What is a method
- What is the special `__init__` method and how to use it
- What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributes to object and classes
- What is the `__dict__` of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain
- How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
- How to use the `getattr` function

## Resources

### Object Oriented Programming
- [Learn Python - Object Oriented Programming](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Object_Oriented_Programming) (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” excluded. You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, classmethod and staticmethod yet)
- [Python Documentation - Object-Oriented Programming](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) (Please *be careful*: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything in the following paragraphs: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes (You DON’T have to learn about class attributes), Methods, The __init__ Method, “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “Public, Protected, and Private Attributes”)
- [Python Course - Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php)

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.\*) style
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)
